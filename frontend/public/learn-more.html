            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>InfluenceRank is a platform that ranks influencers based on their engagement quality, reach, and overall
                influence on social media. Our goal is to help brands and marketers identify influencers who genuinely
                engage with their audience, rather than simply looking at follower counts.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We gather data from various social media platforms including

                <li><strong>Engagement Analysis:</strong> We analyze the quality of interactions between the influencer
                    and their followers.</li>
                <li><strong>InfluenceScore:</strong> Based on this analysis, an overall influence score is calculated to
                    give a clear picture of the influencer's reach and engagement.</li>
            </ul>
